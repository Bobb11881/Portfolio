So this program was meant to be a very simplified version of a registration "app", I guess you could call it.
It just lets you register for three IT courses from a list of seven and then tells you which ones you registered for.
I think I did the debugging pretty well, as well as formatting. It was pretty much just a debugging exercise, but I also enjoyed finding the best and most readable way to format the code.
Well I didn't actually make the UI, it was provided for me. I just made sure it functioned properly.
The first thing during the debugging process I always did was look for compiling errors. They were usually simple typos, so nothing too hard to figure out. Then I looked for logic errors.
Those were tougher and usually required me to go line-by-line to see if anything was out of place, but the programs were short so it also wasn't too big a deal.
I need to come up with a better system for future, larger programs.
Honestly I can't think of a place or time where I was particularly innovative. These programs weren't exactly rocket science so there wasn't too much room for innovation in the first place.
